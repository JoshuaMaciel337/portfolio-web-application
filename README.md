# Portfolio Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a simple portfolio web application built using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. The application showcases various portfolio projects dynamically rendered on the homepage. It features multiple sections highlighting different types of creative work, along with corresponding images.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-web-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-web-app
   ```

3. **Setup a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Flask:**
   If you have a `requirements.txt`, use the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If not, you can manually install Flask:

   ```

5. **Run the application:**

   ```

6. **Visit the application:**

## Usage
